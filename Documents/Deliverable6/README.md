You have two options to run the code, you can either download the BetterBallot.jar file and run the current version, or you can pull the project and run the code on your favorite IDE.

Running the JAR file there should be no necessary requirments to run the application.

If you want to run the code on your favorite IDE you must load the mySQL JDBC driver and configure your build path to include the driver. 

After starting Better Ballot, you can create a new user and run the application in the "Voter" user. 

If you would like to run it as a admin just log in using the username "1" and password "1" or Username "admin" Password "admin"
