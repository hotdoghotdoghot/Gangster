SD1:
The ConfigureUserController is the controller because it is the first part of the process
and tells everything else what to do. The DBConnection is the information expert because
it is responsible for handling and knowing the information given by Voter. And Voter is the
creator because it instantiates the Voter object and userName information that the method is
using.

SD2:
The ConfigureBalletController is the controller because like the ConfigureUserController it
tells everything else what to do in the start. The DBConnection is the information expert
because it is responsible for handling and knowing the information given by Ballet. And
Ballet is the creator because it instantiates and creates the Ballet object and balletName
that the method is using.
